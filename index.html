      <h2>In 2+ sentences describe who you are and what you do.</h2>
      <p>I graduated from the University of Massachusetts in 2011 and began
      pursuing a career in software development.  For 2 years I worked in
      Virginia for a government contractor before leaving to pursue a position
      more in line with my goals.</p>

      <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
      <p>I am taking this course because I have had only a short foray into web
      development.  I want to continue to add new skills to my repertoire and
      web development is something I have enjoyed immensely in the little work I
      have done with it.</p>

      <h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
      <p>I have done a small amount of work in HTML and CSS, but all my previous
      work has been very basic.  I have written some basic websites, and have
      some academic experience with the Python-based web framework Django.</p>

      <h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
      <p>I have a degree in Computer Science with a focus in Software
      Engineering from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have extensive
      programming experience in object-oriented languages. My work has primarily
      been in Java and Python, though I have worked in C/C++, C#, and PHP.</p>

      <h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
      <p>I taught myself PHP in 2010 while working an internship for an online
      marketing company in London. This internship was my very first experience
      with any kind of web development (this is also where I learned HTML and
      JavaScript).  Since that 4 month internship, I've used PHP very little</p>

      <h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
      <p>My preferred platform for development is Linux.  For this course, I
      will be working in Linux Mint 16.</p>

      <h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
